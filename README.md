This addon attempts to read the current number of players online on Ascension Classless WOW on the 3.3.5 client.  This is not an accurate measure of the number of players online but because currently /who is disabled.  Instead it counts the number of players in the world chat.  Very early version of the addon and is pretty much guaranteed not to work for most configurations.  

- You need to be in the world chat channel
- No additional chat channels are supported as this might break the addon
- Under the Social - Chat tab you should only have "World" in the Custom channel list
- If the addon does not refresh, you can manually force a refresh in the Custom channel list by selecting a different channel and then manually selecting the World channel, this should populate the list of names on the right and allow the addon to update the count
